DESCRIPTION:

Hey guys, welcome to my portfolio! Here is a little bit about me.  After graduating in 2017 with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer information Systems, I spent a year working both as a freelance web developer and designer and as part of a team in various non prorofits across NYC. I acquired project and time management skills, as well as the ability to communicate with team members and clients while effectively meeting milestones and deadlines.

As a freelance web developer and designer I collaborated with several graphic designers and clients.

I have worked on a multitude of web projects for a range of clients providing Web Development (PHP, HTML, CSS, LESS, JS, jQuery, WordPress, Bootstrap, Responsive Layouts).

I am currently looking for job opportunities, I am always available to discuss your project over the phone or via Skype. These days I enjoy spending my free time riding my bike in Central Park, or reading a book and drinking tea.
